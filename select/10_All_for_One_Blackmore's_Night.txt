All for one, and one for all
We'll fight together
And when we fight, we'll fight together, not alone

And if we fall, we'll fall together, not alone
We'll fall together
And if we fall, we'll fall together, not alone
All for one, and one for all!
We'll fall together
And if we fall, we'll fall together, not alone!
All for one, and one for all

We'll fall together
And if we fall, we'll fall together, not alone
